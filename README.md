- 👋 Hi, I’m Andy; I have over a decade of experience with DBs, full-stack development, and C++.
- 👀 I’m interested in C/C++, Rust, Zig, optimization, and all things database-related.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust and Zig.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that involves DBs, lower-level code, ML, MLOps, and/or general-purpose utility, such as [Detexify](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) or [Shapecatcher](http://shapecatcher.com/), for example.
- 📫 I have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-v/) - feel free to reach out there if professionally interested. I have research experience with Convolutional Neural Network hyperparameter training for computer vision, as well as some DS and ML background as both a Math and CS major. Additionally, I have over a decade of experience in technology support and development, from frontend to backend and plenty in between.
